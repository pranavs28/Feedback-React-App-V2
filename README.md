# Feedback UI React App

This project is a feedback app designed as a React tool to add, update, and delete feedback reviews from a JSON-Server mock backend API. It features the ability to add feedback posts including a review and rating, as well as the ability to update and delete feedback from the mock JSON-Server.


To start, run `yarn dev` to start the JSON server and locally host a development server for the React frontend.
